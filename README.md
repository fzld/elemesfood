## Workflow

Here's my workflow when building this website

```bash
# creating nuxt app
$ npx create-nuxt-app elemesfood

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# creating tailwind config file
$ npx tailwindcss init

# setup colors and font inside Tailwind config file, then code the components and pages and deploy to Heroku
```


## `Colors and Fonts`

Setup for the colors and font is done by tailwind config by doing this to make stylesheet output

### `difficulty`

For the difficulties that I face during this challenge is actually on some breakpoints issues.

I still figuring out how to make this overflow container scrollable and swipeable without showing the scrolls and with buttons as well.

And I have a little bit of problem with label form on the footer

### `potential`

I think I should've make data.js and use v-for for the cards, it would be better.
And I still look for the solution for the problem that I mention above for the time left.

### Installation

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

### `Input for Elemes.id Website`

this is my personal opinion; I think Elemes.id need a clear call to action section instead of email inputs. That's it!
